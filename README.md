# TSN-VGLCM
Texture similarity network (TSN) is the individual-level construction approach of the SCN based on the sMRI-derived voxel-wise 3D gray‐level co‐occurrence matrix (VGLCM) texture feature maps, which can provide detailed spatial information and dramatically diminishes the influence of insufficient areas definition on texture feature calculation.
